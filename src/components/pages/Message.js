          On behalf of the executive team, members and volunteers, I would like

          considering as a social responsibility to support diverse local and
          international communities those are in need of basic necessities of
          life; shelter, food, clean drinking water and education. As an
          Executive Director, I firmly believe that increased involvement of
          blessed and fortune individuals and families is the only way to create
          a sustainable and prosperous society, and to share happiness among
          those who are in need. I urge you to consider joining TIF Canada as

          important projects to improve the life of poor and needy families. I

          partnership with generous donors and volunteers.
